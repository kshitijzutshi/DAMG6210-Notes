------------------------------------------------ Example of a CASE function --------------------------------------------------------------
** CASE function allows conditional processing
** The ROUND function does number rounding
  eg. SELECT ProductID, Name, ListPrice
             , (SELECT ROUND(AVG(ListPrice),2) AS AvgPrice
                FROM Production.Product) AP
             , CASE
                  WHEN ListPrice - (SELECT ROUND(AVG(ListPrice), 2) 
                       AS AvgPrice FROM Production.Product) = 0
                       THEN 'Average Price'
                  WHEN ListPrice - (SELECT ROUND(AVG(ListPrice), 2) 
                       AS AvgPrice FROM Production.Product) < 0
                       THEN 'Below Average Price'
                  ELSE 'Above Average Price'
                END AS PriceComparison
      FROM Production.Product
      ORDER BY ListPrice DESC;

------------------------------------------- Example of a RANK/DENSE_RANK function --------------------------------------------------------------
** Use the RANK function without/with the PARTITION BY clause to return the rank of each row.
   If the PARTITIAN BY clause is not used, the entire row set returned by a query will be treated as a single big partition.
** When the PARTITIAN BY clause is used, the ranking will be performed within each partitioning value.
** RANK function does not always return consecutive integers. Sometimes we say the RANK function creates gaps.
 eg.
    SELECT
          RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY ProductID ORDER BY OrderQty DESC) AS [Rank],
          SalesOrderID, ProductID, UnitPrice, OrderQty
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
    WHERE UnitPrice >75;

** the numbers returned by the DENSE_RANK function do not have gaps and always have consecutive ranks.
 eg. 
    USE AdventureWorks2008R2;
    GO
    SELECT i.ProductID, p.Name, i.LocationID, i.Quantity
           ,DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY i.LocationID ORDER BY i.Quantity DESC) AS Rank
    FROM Production.ProductInventory AS i
    INNER JOIN Production.Product AS p
        ON i.ProductID = p.ProductID
    WHERE i.LocationID BETWEEN 3 AND 4
    ORDER BY i.LocationID;
    GO
 
 ** How to Best Work on SQL RANK Question
 1) Assign an alias to the new column, AND don’t change any other part of the original SQL statement.
 2) The new column is usually based on an existing column contained in the SELECT clause of the original SQL statement. 
 3) The existing column can be either a regular column or an aggregated column.
 4) The default order is ASC. If we want the descending order, specify DESC.
 
--------------------------------------------- Remove Duplicates From A Table --------------------------------------------------------------
** Option 1： 
-- Use ROW_NUMBER() with PARTITION BY
              DELETE dupes
              FROM (SELECT ROW_NUMBER()
                    OVER (PARTITION BY Name ORDER BY Name) rownum
                    FROM NameList) dupes
              WHERE dupes.rownum > 1;   
-- Validate duplicates have been removed
             SELECT Name FROM NameList 
             ORDER BY Name;
** Option 2
-- Use SELECT DISTINCT INTO a new table
             SELECT DISTINCT Name
             INTO NewTable
             FROM NameList;

--------------------------------------------- SQL variables AND While --------------------------------------------------------------
** SQL variables start with either @ or @@.
       @ indicates a local variable, which is in effect in the current scope.
       @@ indicates a global variable, which is in effect for all scopes of the current connection.

** simple example of WHILE Statement
       We use the variable @counter in this example to determine when to terminate the WHILE loop in this example.
       We use CAST to convert an integer to character(s) so that we can concatenate the integer with other characters. 
   eg.   
       DECLARE @counter INT;
       SET @counter = 0;
       WHILE @counter <> 5
         BEGIN
           SET @counter = @counter + 1;
           PRINT 'The counter : ' + CAST(@counter AS CHAR);
         END;
