** Normalization **
A technique for producing a set of relations with desirable properties, given the data requirements of an enterprise.

** Functional Dependencies **
B is functionally dependent on A /  A functionally determines B, means if each value of A is associated with exactly one value of B
##  A -> B, A = Determinant 
    staffNo -> position
    
** full functional dependency **
B is fully functionally dependent on A, means B is functionally dependent on A, but not on any proper subset of A
## full functional dependency 
   if removal of any attribute from A results in the dependency no longer existing
## there must be a full functional dependency between the attribute(s) on the left-hand and right-hand sides of the dependency

** partial dependency **
   if there is some attribute that can be removed from A and yet the dependency still holds.
eg. 
   full functional dependency : staffNo -> branchNo
   partial dependency : staffNo, sName -> branchNo  

** Transitive dependency **
If A -> B and B -> C, then C is transitively dependent on A via B (provided that a is not functionally dependent on B or C)

** anomalies **
Relations with data redundancy suffer from update anomalies, which can be classified as insertion, deletion, and modification anomalies.

** The Process of Normalization **
   Become progressively more restricted (stronger) in format and also less vulnerable to update anomalies.
1. Three normal forms were initially proposed called First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), and Third Normal Form (3NF)
2. only First Normal Form (1NF) that is critical in creating relations
   
   Process:
                           UNF    
                            |     [Remove repeating groups]                       
                           1NF
                            |     [Remove partial dependencies] 
                           2NF
                            |     [Remove transitive dependencies] 
                           3NF 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
** First Normal Form (1NF) **
   A relation in which the intersection of each row and column contains one and only one value.
## Identify and remove repeating groups within the table, repeating groups: occurs with multiple values.
## Two common approaches to removing repeating groups from unnormalized tables:
 1> “flattening” the table:
    fill in the blanks by duplicating the nonrepeating data, where required
 2> By placing the repeating data, along with a copy of the original key attribute(s), in a separate relation.

** Second Normal Form (2NF) **
   A relation that is in first normal form and every non-primary-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key
   Based on the concept of full functional dependency, relation with a single-attribute primary key is automatically in at least 2NF
# A relation that is in first normal form and every non-candidate-key attribute is fully functionally dependent on any candidate key
   
** Third Normal Form (3NF) **
   A relation that is in 1NF & 2NF and where no non-primary-key attribute is transitively dependent on the primary key
   Remove the transitively dependent attribute(s) from the relation by placing the attribute(s) in a new relation along with a copy of the determinant
# A relation that is in first and second normal form and in which no non-candidate-key attribute is transitively dependent on any candidate key
