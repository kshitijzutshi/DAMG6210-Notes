** Entity Types **
A group of objects with the same properties, which are identified by the enterprise as having an independent existence.

** Relationship Types **
A set of meaningful associations among entity types. 

** Degree of Relationship Type **
The number of participating entity types in a relationship. 
1. A relationship of degree two is called binary.
   An example of a binary relationship is the Has relationship.
2. A relationship of degree three is called ternary. 
   An example of a ternary relationship is Registers with three participating entity types: Staff , Branch , and Client.

** Recursive Relationship **
A relationship type in which the same entity type participates more than once in different roles.
  eg 1. Supervises, which represents an association of staff with a Supervisor where the Supervisor is also a member of staff.  
  eg 2. Staff and Branch entity types are associated through two distinct relationships called Manages and Has.
  
** Attributes **
1. A property of an entity or a relationship type. 
2. Each attribute is associated with a set of values called a domain.
  eg. Simple and Composite Attributes, Single-valued and Multi-valued Attributes, Derived Attributes

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Candidate key **
The minimal set of attributes that uniquely identifies each occurrence of an entity type.

** Primary key **
The candidate key that is selected to uniquely identify each occurrence of an entity type.

** Composite key **
A candidate key that consists of two or more attributes.
  eg. Many properties are advertised in many newspapers on a given date. 
      Thus, the Advert entity type has a composite primary key made up of the propertyNo , newspaperName , and dateAdvert attributes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Strong Entity **
An entity type that is not existence-dependent on some other entity type.
  eg. Figure include the Staff , Branch , PropertyForRent , and Client entities
      a strong entity type is that each entity occurrence is uniquely identifiable using the primary key attribute(s) of that entity type

** Weak Entity **
An entity type that is existence-dependent on some other entity type.
  eg 1. the Preference entity can be described as having existence dependency for the Client entity, which is referred to as being the owner entity.
     2. also referred to as child, dependent, or subordinate entities and strong entity types as parent, owner, or dominant entities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Structural Constraints **
1. Multiplicity
   Multiplicity constrains the way that entities are related.
   The number (or range) of possible occurrences of an entity type that may relate to a single occurrence of an associated entity type through a particular relationship.
## Binary relationships are generally referred to as being:
 • one-to-one (1:1): a member of staff manages a branch (1:1)
&& a member of staff can manage zero or one branch and each branch is managed by one member of staff.
 • one-to-many (1:*): a member of staff oversees properties for rent (1:*)
&& a member of staff can oversee zero or more properties for rent and a property for rent is overseen by zero or one member of staff.
 • many-to-many (*:*): newspapers advertise properties for rent (*:*)
&& one newspaper advertises one or more properties for rent and one property for rent is advertised in zero or more newspapers.

   Multiplicity actually consists of two separate constraints known as cardinality and participation.
## 1) Cardinality: 
   Describes the maximum number of possible relationship occurrences for an entity participating in a given relationship type.
   The cardinality of a binary relationship is what we previously referred to as a one-to-one (1:1), one-to-many (1:*), and many-to-many (*:*). 
## 2) Participation:
   Determines whether all or only some entity occurrences participate in a relationship.
   Involved in a particular relationship (referred to as mandatory participation) or only some (referred to as optional participation).
   Optional participation is represented by the minimum value on the opposite side of the relationship.
   Optional participation is represented as a minimum value of 0, and mandatory participation is shown as a minimum value of 1.

** Problems with ER Models **
1. Fan trap exists where a model represents a relationship between entity types, but the pathway between certain entity occurrences is ambiguous.
2. Chasm trap exists where a model suggests the existence of a relationship between entity types, but the pathway does not exist between certain entity occurrences.
