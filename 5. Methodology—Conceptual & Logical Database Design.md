** Conceptual database design **
The process of constructing a model of the data used in an enterprise, independent of all physical considerations.
   1> The main objective of Step 1 of the methodology is to build a conceptual data model of the data requirements of the enterprise. 
   2> A conceptual data model comprises: entity types, relationship types, attributes, attribute domains, primary keys, and alternate keys.

** Logical database design **
The process of constructing a model of the data used in an enterprise based on a specific data model
But independent of a particular DBMS and other physical considerations.
   1> A logical data model includes ER diagram(s), relational schema
   2> supporting documentation such as the data dictionary, which is produced throughout the development of the model.
   
** Physical database design **
The process of producing a description of the implementation of the database on secondary storage; 
it describes the base relations, file organizations, and indexes used to achieve efficient access to the data, and any associated integrity constraints and security measures.

Conceptual database design
Step 1 Build conceptual data model
     1.1 Identify entity types                1.2 Identify relationship types
     1.3 Identify and associate attributes with entity or relationship types
     1.4 Determine attribute domains          1.5 Determine candidate, primary, and alternate key attributes
     1.6 Consider use of enhanced modeling concepts (optional step)
     1.7 Check model for redundancy           1.8 Validate conceptual data model against user transactions
     1.9 Review conceptual data model with user

Logical database design for the relational model
Step 2 Build logical data model
     2.1 Derive relations for logical data model         2.2 Validate relations using normalization
     2.3 Validate relations against user transactions    2.4 Check integrity constraints
     2.5 Review logical data model with user.            2.6 Merge logical data models into global model (optional step) 
     2.7 Check for future growth

Physical database design for relational databases
Step 3 Translate logical data model for target DBMS
     3.1 Design base relations               3.2 Design representation of derived data
     3.3 Design general constraints
Step 4 Design file organizations and indexes
     4.1 Analyze transactions                4.2 Choose file organizations
     4.3 Choose indexes                      4.4 Estimate disk space requirements
Step 5 Design user views
Step 6 Design security mechanisms
Step 7 Consider the introduction of controlled redundancy
Step 8 Monitor and tune the operational system

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1
## 1. When identify relationship types
Use Entityâ€“Relationship (ER) diagrams, to represent entities and how they relate to one another more easily
## 2. A conceptual data model is supported by documentation, such as ER diagrams and a data dictionary, which is
produced throughout the development of the model.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2
## 1. We describe how relations are derived for the following structures that may occur in a conceptual data model:
(1) strong entity types;
(2) weak entity types;
(3) one-to-many (1:*) binary relationship types;
(4) one-to-one (1:1) binary relationship types;
(5) one-to-one (1:1) recursive relationship types;
(6) superclass/subclass relationship types;
(7) many-to-many (*:*) binary relationship types;
(8) complex relationship types;
(9) multi-valued attributes.

## 2. The relational schema is validated using the rules of normalization to ensure that each relation is structurally correct.
      Normalization is used to improve the model so that it satisfies various constraints that avoids unnecessary duplication of data. 
      
## 3. Integrity constraints: imposed on the database to protect the database from becoming incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent.
