**Database**
   
   A collection of related data 

**Database management system (DBMS)**

   software that manages and controls access to the database

**Database application**

   A program that interacts with the database at some point in its execution

**Database system**

   A collection of application programs that interact with the database along with the DBMS and the database itself

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Traditional File-Based Systems**

A collection of application programs that perform services for the end-users, such as the production of reports. Each program defines and manages its own data.

## A file is simply a collection of records, which contains logically related data. 

## Limitations of the File-Based Approach:
   1. Separation and isolation of data
   2. Duplication of data
   3. Data dependence
   4. Incompatible file formats
   5. Fixed queries/proliferation of application programs

**Database**

   A shared collection of logically related data and its description, designed to meet the information needs of an organization.

The description of the data is known as the system catalog (or data dictionary or metadata—the “data about data”).

An entity is a distinct object (a person, place, thing, concept, or event) in the organization that is to be represented in the database.

An attribute is a property that describes some aspect of the object that we wish to record

A relationship is an association between entities. 

**Database Management System (DBMS)**

   A software system that enables users to define, create, maintain, and control access to the database.
## 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
      DDL allows users to specify the data types and structures and the constraints on the data to be stored in the database. 
## 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
      It allows users to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from the database
      DML can provide a general inquiry facility to this data, called a query language
   The most common query language is the Structured Query Language (SQL)
      It provides controlled access to the database

**(Database) Application Programs**

   A computer program that interacts with the database by issuing an appropriate request (typically an SQL statement) to the DBMS.

## Components of the DBMS Environment:
        hardware    software              data              procedures    people
            (Machine)                   (Bridge)                    (Human)
                            Schema: the structure of the database 
                           Database design: determine the structure of the database
                           
**Roles in the Database environment**

   1. Data and Database Administrators     2. Database Designers     
   3. Application Developers               4. End-Users

**History of Database Management Systems**

1. The CODASYL and hierarchical approaches represented the first generation of DBMSs.
2. Relational DBMSs are referred to as second-generation DBMSs. 
3. The object-oriented DBMS (OODBMS) and the object-relational DBMS (ORDBMS) are referred to as third-generation DBMSs.
4. Data warehousing systems appear -- Web–database integration -- XML

**Advantages of DBMSs**

               Control of data redundancy                     economy
                of scale
               Data consistency                               Balance of conflicting requirements
               More information from the same amount of data
               Improved data accessibility and responsiveness
               Sharing of data                                Increased productivity
               Improved data integrity                        Improved maintenance through data independence
               Improved security                              Increased concurrency
               enforcement of standards                       Improved backup and recovery services

**Disadvantages**

               Complexity                 Size
               Cost of DBMSs              Additional hardware costs
               Cost of conversion
               Performance                Greater impact of a failure
