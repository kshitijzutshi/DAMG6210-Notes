** Database System History **
• ‘File Cabinet’ Database (paper systems)   • Hierarchical Database
• Network Database                          • Relational Database
• Object Database                           • NoSQL

## Object Database 
1. Provided Object Oriented features, such as encapsulation and polymorphism
2. Suffered due to lack of standardization

## NoSQL
1. Umbrella term for all databases and data stores that don’t follow strict RDBMS principles 
2. Relate to large data sets accessed and manipulated on Web scale
3. Represents collection of diverse, and sometimes related, concepts about data storage and manipulation
4. Characteristics
   Non-Relational Database                   Big Data
   Distributed Storage & Processing          Open Source
   Less expensive hardware                   Batch Processing（Google Map Reduce）
   Interactive and Stream Processing （Apache Tez Framework，Apache Spark，Facebook Presto）
   Denormalization at ingestion to speed up query
   Append instead of update to improve performance
   Schema-agnostic
5. NoSQL Database Use Cases
   Key‐value stores
     Simple binary values, lists, maps, and strings
   Columnar stores
    Related information values can be grouped in column families
     (support very wide tables but not relationships between tables)
   Document stores
    Highly complex parent‐child hierarchal structures
     (keep JSON and/or XML hierarchical structures)
   Triple and Graph stores
    A web of interrelated information 

## RDBMS vs NoSQL
Denormalizing tables, dropping constraints, and relaxing transactional guarantee can help an RDBMS scale 
But after these modifications, an RDBMS starts resembling a NoSQL product

## Three V’s of Big Data
• Volume     • Variety    • Velocity
