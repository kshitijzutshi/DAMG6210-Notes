** How does database fit in the overall application infrastructure?

----------------------------------Stages of database development lifecycle----------------------------------------------------------------------
** Database Design **
1. Three phases of database design:
 • Conceptual database design       • Logical database design      • Physical database design
   
2. Main approaches include:
 • Top-down
   # Identify high-level entities   # Gather required attributes and place them in entities   # Fine tune
 • Bottom-up
   # Gather required attributes     # Group attributes into entities                          # Fine tune
   
** Application Design **
 • Design of application that uses and processes the database
 • Database design and application design are parallel activities
 
 
---------------------------------Software tools to facilitate database development---------------------------------------------------------
** CASE Tools **
 • Features provided by CASE tools include:
   # Data dictionary      # Support data analysis     #Develop conceptual, logical, and physical models
 • Provide following benefits:
   # Standardization       # Integration        # Consistency       # Automation
 • Forward Engineering
   # Generate code to implement database based on design
 • Reverse Engineering
   # Read an existing database and create ERD
   
---------------------------------------------------SQL Concepts----------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Role of SQL Commands **
                       Front End Programs             SQL ANSI                  Relational Database Server
                              ■             <--------------------------->                    ■ 
                         Application              Standard Commands                      SQL Server
                            Excel                                                          Oracle
                            Access                                                         Access
                            SSMS                                                           MySQL         
  • SQL ANSI standard commands are sent from the front end to the back end server
  • Back end server:
    # Parses command to determine action to be taken     # Completes the action     # Returns results
  • All relational databases have their own proprietary SQL commands
  • TSQL: Transact SQL 
          ANSI Standard SQL + MS SQL Server Proprietary Commands
   
** SQL Command Categories **
  • DML: Data Manipulation Language -– Selects and alters data
  • DDL: Data Definition Language -– Creates, alters, and drops database objects
  • DCL: Data Control Language -– Controls users’ permissions
eg.
  1.DML: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
  2.DDL: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, CREATE VIEW, ALTER VIEW, DROP VIEW
  3.DCL: GRANT, REVOKE, DENY

---------------------------------------------------SELECT (Transact-SQL)----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          SELECT select_list [ INTO new_table ]
                                          FROM [ table_source ]
                                          WHERE [ search_condition ]
                                          GROUP BY [ group_by_expression ]
                                          HAVING [ search_condition ]
                                          ORDER BY [ order_expression [ ASC | DESC ] ]

** WHERE **
• After the FROM clause in a SELECT command
• Filters rows

-------------------------------------------------------Lab Example-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ## In Production.Product 
    Production is the schema name  >>>  Schema is used for organizing database objects or controlling access
    Product is the table name.

** Count number of distinct values in the CreditCardID column
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CreditCardID) "Unique Credit Cards"
   FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader;

** Demo many different aggregate functions and different ways to specify column alias names
   SELECT MIN(OrderQty) AS [Minimum Quantity],
          MAX(OrderQty) AS [Maximum Quantity],
          [Total] = SUM(OrderQty),
          AVG(OrderQty) AverageQuantity,    -- AverageQuantity is alias
          SUM(OrderQty)/COUNT(OrderQty),    -- No column heading, no alias
          COUNT(*) AS "Count"
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
    WHERE OrderQty BETWEEN 30 AND 50;

## The COUNT function is commonly used together with GROUP BY
##  When the COUNT is used in the SELECT clause, all other columns of the SELECT clause must be contained in the GROUP BY clause.
    If this syntax rule is not met, we’ll get an error. 
  SELECT CustomerID, AccountNumber, COUNT(SalesOrderID) AS '# of Orders'
  FROM AdventureWorks2008R2.Sales.SalesOrderHeader
  GROUP BY CustomerID, AccountNumber
  ORDER BY '# of Orders' DESC;

-----------------------------------------------------Using the OVER clause-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ## provide aggregated values for each department
    SELECT DISTINCT Name  
       , MIN(Rate) OVER (PARTITION BY edh.DepartmentID) AS MinSalary  
       , MAX(Rate) OVER (PARTITION BY edh.DepartmentID) AS MaxSalary

   JOIN HumanResources.Department AS d  
       ON d.DepartmentID = edh.DepartmentID  
   WHERE edh.EndDate IS NULL  
   ORDER BY Name;  
   
 ## return the price of the least expensive product in each sales order
    SELECT DISTINCT MIN(UnitPrice) OVER(PARTITION BY SalesOrderNumber) AS LeastExpensiveProduct,  
           SalesOrderNumber  
    FROM dbo.FactResellerSales    
    WHERE SalesOrderNumber IN (N'SO43659', N'SO43660', N'SO43664')  
   ORDER BY SalesOrderNumber; 
 
 ## provide a moving average of yearly sales for each territory
    SELECT BusinessEntityID, TerritoryID   
       ,DATEPART(yy,ModifiedDate) AS SalesYear  
       ,CONVERT(varchar(20),SalesYTD,1) AS  SalesYTD  
       ,CONVERT(varchar(20),AVG(SalesYTD) OVER (PARTITION BY TerritoryID   
                                                ORDER BY DATEPART(yy,ModifiedDate)   
                                                ),1) AS MovingAvg  
       ,CONVERT(varchar(20),SUM(SalesYTD) OVER (PARTITION BY TerritoryID   
                                                ORDER BY DATEPART(yy,ModifiedDate)

    FROM Sales.SalesPerson  
    WHERE TerritoryID IS NULL OR TerritoryID < 5  
    ORDER BY TerritoryID,SalesYear;  
    
---------------------------------------------------------COUNT-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ## return the departments in a company that have more than 15 employees
    SELECT DepartmentName, 
           COUNT (EmployeeKey) AS EmployeeInDept
    FROM dob.DimEmployee
    GROUP BY DepartmentName
    HAVING COUNT(EmployeeKey) > 15;
    
## return the number of products that are contained in each of the specified sales orders.
   SELECT DISTINCT COUNT (ProductKey) OVER (PARTITION BY SalesOrderNumber) AS ProductCount,
          SalesOrderNamber
   FROM dbo.FactInternetSales  
   WHERE SalesOrderNumber IN (N'SO53115',N'SO55981');  
   
---------------------------------------------------------RANK-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ## ranks the products in inventory the specified inventory locations according to their quantities    
    USE AdventureWorks2012;  
    GO
    SELECT i.ProductID, p.Name, i.LocationID, i.Quantity
           , RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY i.LocationID ORDER BY i.Quantity DESC) AS Rank

    GO

 ## returns the top ten employees ranked by their salary
    USE AdventureWorks2012
