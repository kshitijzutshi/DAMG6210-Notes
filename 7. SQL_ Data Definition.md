** SQL Data Types **
eg. branchNo CHAR(4)         address VARCHAR(30)
    salary DECIMAL(7,2)      viewDate DATE
Operator:
 1. LOWER / UPPER: Converts uppercase & lowercase letters
 2. CAST: Converts a value expression of one data type into a value in another data type  
 3. CASE: Returns one of a specified set of values, based on some condition
    eg. CASE type
             WHEN ‘House’  THEN 1
             WHEN ‘Flat’   THEN 2
             ELSE 0
        END
 4. CURRENT_DATE: Returns the current date in the time zone that is local to the user.

** Integrity enhancement Feature **
   Integrity protect the database from becoming inconsistent
1. Required Data
   eg. position VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
2. Domain Constraints
   eg. sex CHAR NOT NULL CHECK ( sex IN (‘M’, ‘F’))
3. Entity Integrity
   eg. PRIMARY KEY( clientNo, propertyNo )
4. Referential Integrity
   eg. FOREIGN KEY( branchNo ) REFERENCES Branch
5. General Constraints
   eg. CREATE ASSERTION StaffNotHandlingTooMuch
           CHECK (NOT EXISTS (SELECT staffNo
                              FROM PropertyForRent
                              GROUP BY staffNo
                              HAVING COUNT(*) > 100))
                              
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Data Definition **
1. CREATE TABLE
   eg. CREATE DOMAIN OwnerNumber AS VARCHAR(5)
          CHECK (VALUE IN (SELECT ownerNo FROM PrivateOwner));
2. ALTER TABLE
   eg. ALTER TABLE Staff
           ALTER position DROP DEFAULT;
           ALTER sex SET DEFAULT ‘F’ ;
   eg. ALTER TABLE Client
           ADD prefNoRooms PropertyRooms;
3. DROP TABLE
   eg. DROP TABLE PropertyForRent;
4. CREATE INDEX
An index is a structure that provides accelerated access to the rows of a table based on the values of one or more columns
   eg. CREATE UNIQUE INDEX PropertyNoInd ON PropertyForRent ( propertyNo );
5. DROP INDEX
   eg. DROP INDEX Rentlnd ;

** Views **
The dynamic result of one or more relational operations operating on the base relations to produce another relation. 
A view is a virtual relation that does not necessarily exist in the database but can be produced at the time of request.

1. CREATE VIEW
  #1.1 Create a horizontal view (restricts a user’s access to selected rows of one or more tables)
   eg. Create a view so that the manager at branch B003 can see the details only for staff who work in his or her branch office.
     CREATE VIEW Manager3Staff
     AS SELECT *
        FROM Staff
        WHERE branchNo = ‘B003’;
 
  #1.2 Create a vertical view
   eg. Create a view of the staff details at branch B003 that excludes salary information
       so that only managers can access the salary details for staff who work at their branch.
     CREATE VIEW Staff3
     AS SELECT staffNo, fName, IName, position, sex
        FROM Manager3Staff ;
  
  #1.3 Grouped and joined views
    eg. Create a view of staff who manage properties for rent, which includes the branch number they work at, their staff number, and the number of properties they manage
      CREATE VIEW StaffPropCnt ( branchNo , staffNo , cnt )
      AS SELECT s. branchNo , s. staffNo , COUNT(*) AS [PropertySum]
         FROM Staff s, PropertyForRent p
         WHERE s. staffNo = p.staffNo
         BY s.branchNo , s.staffNo 

2. DROP VIEW
   eg. DROP VIEW Manager3Staff ;

3. Restrictions on Views
##1> If a column in the view is based on an aggregate function
     then the column may appear only in SELECT and ORDER BY clauses of queries that access the view.
##2> A grouped view may never be joined with a base table or a view.   
   
4. Advantages and Disadvantages of Views
       Advantages                               Disadvantages 
     Data independence                        Update restriction
     Currency                                 Structure restriction
     Improved security                        Performance
     Reduced complexity
     Convenience
     Customization
     Data integrity
