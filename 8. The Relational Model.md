** Terminology **

   Relational Data Structure
1. Relation: is a table with columns and rows.
             |        A relation is represented as a two-dimensional table in which the rows of the table 
             |        correspond to individual records and the table columns correspond to attributes
2. Attribute: is a named column of a relation.

3. Domain: is the set of allowable values for one or more attributes.
   Every attribute in a relation is defined on a domain.
   
4. Tuple: is a row of a relation.
   Elements of a relation are the rows or tuples in the table.
   
5. Degree of a relation: is the number of attributes it contains.
   A relation with two attributes is called binary.
   
6. cardinality of a relation: is the number of tuples it contains.

7. Relational database: A collection of normalized relations with distinct relation names.
   
   Alternative terminology
1. Relation -- Table --  File
2. Tuple -- Row -- Record
3. Attribute -- Column -- Field

** Database Relations **
   A named relation defined by a set of attribute and domain name pairs.
eg. {( branchNo : B005, street : 22 Deer Rd, city : London, postcode : SW1 4EH)}  -- relation instance

** Relational database schema 
   A set of relation schemas, each with a distinct name.
 ## 
 A relation that satisfies this property is said to be normalized or in first normal form.
 
** Relational Keys **
1. There may be several candidate keys for a relation.
2. When a key consists of more than one attribute, we call it a composite key.

## Primary key: 
   The candidate key that is selected to identify tuples uniquely within the relation.
## Foreign key:
   An attribute, or set of attributes, within one relation that matches the candidate key of some (possibly the same) relation.
eg. In the Staff relation, branchNo is a foreign key
               branchNo   ---   in the Staff relation 
                  |     targets 
               branchNo   ---   the primary key attribute in the home relation --- Branch
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Integrity Constraints **
Two important integrity rules: referential integrity & multiplicity

** NULLS **
   Represents a value for an attribute that is currently unknown or is not applicable for this tuple.
   
** Entity Integrity **
   In a base relation, no attribute of a primary key can be null.

** Referential Integrity **
   If a foreign key exists in a relation:
  either the foreign key value must match a candidate key value of some tuple in its home relation;
  or the foreign key value must be wholly null.
  
** General Constraints **
   Additional rules specified by the users or database administrators of a database that define or constrain some aspect of the enterprise.
   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Views **
1. Views are dynamic:
   changes made to the base relations that affect the view are immediately reflected in the view. 
2. Purpose of Views:
   ## provides a powerful and flexible security mechanism by hiding parts of the database from certain users.
   ## permits users to access data in a way that is customized to their needs.
   ## simplify complex operations on the base relations.
3. Not all views are updatable
