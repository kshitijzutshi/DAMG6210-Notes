--------------------------------------------------Indexes--------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Index will improve query performance but slow down INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations

## Types of Indexes
   • Clustered Indexes       • Non-Clustered Indexes      • Both can be unique or non unique
## Index Structure
   • B Tree/B+ Tree        • Root Nodes         • Intermediate Nodes           • Leaf Nodes
   
** Leaf Node **
• Clustered Index
  Leaf Node is the actual data pages
     » Think ‘Dictionary’
• Non-Clustered Index
  Leaf Node is a Key Pointer to data
     » Think ‘regular index’ found in the back of most books
     
** Clustered Table vs Heap
• Clustered Table
  Table that has a clustered index
• Heap
  Table that does not have a clustered index
  
** Distribution Statistics
• Estimates how efficient an index would be for a query
• To be useful:
  1. Must be kept relatively current       2. Can manually UPDATE STATISTICS
  
** Index Maintenance
• Drop / re-create indexes for large data load
• Eliminate Under-Used Indexes
• Add index to improve slow running queries
• Index primary/foreign key columns to improve JOIN performance

--------------------------------------------------Indexes Creation----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Hints
• Assign indexes on most-appropriate column(s)
         PK/FK                                     Provides best JOIN performance
         Other column(s) as appropriate            Which column(s) are queried most?
         Look for table scans on large tables      Determine slowest-running queries---add indexes?

• AVOID indexes on least-appropriate column(s)
 TEXT
  - Better to use FULL-Text indexes
 Other column(s) that are inappropriate
  - Wide columns: if above 20 characters
  - Columns with frequently UPDATE activity

--------------------------------------------------Index Fragmentation----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    • Unavoidable              • OLTP environment
                                    • Causes more than the optimal amount of disk I/O to be performed in accessing a table
                                    • Disk I/Os take longer than they optimally would

## Common Causes of Index Fragmentation
• INSERT and UPDATE operations causing Page splits
• DELETE operations              
• Large row size   

## Types of Index Fragmentation
• Internal Fragmentation
  When pages are less than fully used, the part of each page that is unused constitutes a form of fragmentation
• Logical Fragmentation
  Logical fragmentation occurs when the pages in the doubly linked list are not contiguous in the index
  meaning that indexes have pages in which the logical ordering of pages, which is based on the key value, does not match the physical ordering inside the data file.
• Extent Fragmentation
  Extent fragmentation occurs when the extents of a table or index are not contiguous with the database leaving extents from one or more indexes intermingled in the file.
  
--------------------------------------------------Lab2-2 Example----------------------------------------------------------------------                                
## INNER is the default when JOIN is the only keyword used.
   INNER JOIN returns only matching rows from left and right tables.

## If two tables have the same column name in a query, we must designate where the column is from by using the format
   TableName.ColumnName.  
## If a column name is unique between the JOINed tables, The TableName.ColumnName format is not required.

## LEFT OUTER JOIN returns all rows from the left table, but only the matching rows from the right table. 

## GROUP BY aggregates on the column(s) we specify
## ORDER BY does sorting
 eg. SELECT c.CustomerID,
            PersonID,
            COUNT(SalesOrderID) AS "Total Order"
     FROM Sales.Customer c
     INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader oh
       ON c.CustomerID = oh.CustomerID
     GROUP BY c.CustomerID, PersonID
     ORDER BY "Total Order" DESC;
     
## For regular filtering in a query, we use WHERE.
## If we use GROUP BY in a query, then we use HAVING to do the filtering for groups.
 eg. SELECT c.CustomerID,
            PersonID,
            COUNT(SalesOrderID) AS "Total Order"
     FROM Sales.Customer c 
     INNER JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader oh
       ON c.CustomerID = oh.CustomerID
     GROUP BY c.CustomerID, PersonID
     HAVING COUNT(SalesOrderID) > 20
     ORDER BY "Total Order" DESC;

## IN OPERATOR Can be used with any data type
 eg.
     WHERE Color IN ('Red', 'Blue', 'White') -- character comparison
     WHERE ListPrice IN (337.22, 594.83, 63.50, 8.99) -- numeric comparison

## LIKE operator
1. % is the wildcard symbol representing 0 to many characters
2. - is the wildcard symbol representing exactly one character
 eg 1. Select any person whose last name begins with a
     SELECT FirstName, MiddleName, LastName   FROM Person.Person
     WHERE LastName LIKE 'a%'                 ORDER BY LastName;
 eg 2. Select any person whose last name begins with a or c or e
     SELECT FirstName, MiddleName, LastName   FROM Person.Person
     WHERE LastName LIKE '[ace]%'             ORDER BY LastName;
     
## Subqueries are queries that are embedded in another query.
 eg. 
    SELECT Name [Product],ListPrice,
          (SELECT MAX(ListPrice) FROM Production.Product)
                  AS [Max Price],
                 (ListPrice / (SELECT MAX(ListPrice) FROM Production.Product)) * 100
                  AS [Percent of MAX]
    FROM Production.Product
    WHERE ListPrice > 0
    ORDER BY ListPrice DESC;

-----------------------------------------------INTERSECT and EXCEPT Commands---------------------------------------------------------------------                                
## EXCEPT returns only distinct values from the left query that are not returned from the right query
## INTERSECT returns only distinct values that are returned by both queries

Basic rules:
• Number and order of columns must be the same in all queries.
• Data types must be identical or compatible.
